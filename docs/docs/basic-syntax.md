# Basic Syntax

Ra is designed to be simple and intuitive. Here are some basic syntax examples to get you started.

## Variables and Data Types
Ra supports variables and basic data types like integers, strings, and booleans.

```ra
let x = 10;  # Integer
let name = "Alice";  # String
let isActive = true;  # Boolean
```

## Arithmetic Operations
Ra supports standard arithmetic operations:
```ra
let x = 10;
let y = 5;
let sum = x + y;  # Addition
let product = x * y;  # Multiplication
```

## Comments
Use `#` for single-line comments:
```ra
# This is a comment
let x = 10;  # This is also a comment
```
