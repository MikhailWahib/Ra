# Control Flow

Ra provides basic control flow constructs like conditionals and loops.

## Conditionals
Use `if-else` for conditional logic:
```js
let a = 20;
let b = 10;

if (a > b) {
    puts("a is greater than b");
} else {
    puts("a is less than or equal to b");
}
```

## Loops
Use `while` for looping:
```js
let count = 0;

while (count < 5) {
    count = count + 1;
    puts(count);
}
```
