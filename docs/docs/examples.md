# Examples

Here are some examples to help you get started with Ra.

## Arithmetic Operations
```js
let x = 10;
let y = 5;
let sum = x + y;
let product = x * y;

puts(sum);  # Prints 15
puts(product);  # Prints 50
```

## Compound Assignment
```js
x += 5;  # Equivalent to x = x + 5
y *= 2;  # Equivalent to y = y * 2

puts(x);  # Prints 15
puts(y);  # Prints 10
```
